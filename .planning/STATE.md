# Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-05-19 — Phase 21 planned (4 atomic plans, one per mini-app: LexTrack/Larga/MonitoX/API Playground). Plan-checker PASS first iteration. Ready to execute.

## Project Reference

**Project:** Lexarium — Wallecx
**Reference:** see `.planning/PROJECT.md` for full context, requirements, and constraints
**Core value:** Each authenticated user can save, retrieve, and display their own vaccination records and membership/loyalty cards — without ever losing access to them.
**Current focus:** v3.0 — Site-Wide Dark Mode (theme infrastructure, full-site sweep, NavBar toggle).

## Current Position

**Milestone:** v3.0 — Site-Wide Dark Mode
**Phase:** 21 — Mini-App Dark Mode Sweep
**Plan:** 21-01..04 (4 plans, ~14 tasks total, 0/4 executed)
**Status:** Ready to execute

```
v3.0 Progress: [ Phase 19 ] [ Phase 20 ] [ Phase 21 ] [ Phase 22 ]

## Accumulated Context

### Architectural Invariants (locked)

- **Mini-app, not separate deployment.** Wallecx ships as a Lexarium mini-app at `/projects/wallecx`.
- **Specific collections, not polymorphic vault.** Each record type has its own PocketBase collection (`wallecx_vaccinations`, `wallecx_memberships`).
- **Server-side per-user isolation is the auth boundary.** All five PocketBase rules enforce ownership; the route guard is UX only.
- **Tab shell, not sub-routes.** PrimeVue Tabs with string-typed `activeTab`; each tab owns its own state; no new Pinia store.
- **Direct v-model refs for ManageMembership.vue.** PrimeVue ColorPicker issue #8135 — controlled system ignores initial value. This is the established pattern for membership write path.
- **ConfirmDialog at WallecxApp.vue shell level only.** `useConfirm` broadcasts to single app-shell-level instance; not duplicated in tab components.
- **requestKey per collection.** `'memberships-getFullList'` and `'vaccinations-getFullList'` (or equivalent) must stay distinct to prevent PocketBase auto-cancel.
- **card_color stored without `#` prefix.** All CSS bindings prepend `#`. Zod validates `[0-9a-fA-F]{6}`.
- **iOS fullscreen via viewport overlay.** `position:fixed;inset:0;z-index:9999` — not the Fullscreen API.
- **JsBarcode always in try/catch.** Throws synchronously on invalid input. On catch, render `card_number` as large plain text.

### v2.1 PWA Architectural Decisions (new)

- **registerType: 'prompt' only — never autoUpdate.** Both CRUD forms have unsaved state; a silent SW reload would destroy it.
- **All PocketBase API calls: NetworkOnly.** Auth token lives in localStorage (inaccessible to SW context); stale data risk is unacceptable for a personal vault.
- **navigateFallback: 'index.html' is mandatory.** Without it, navigating to `/projects/wallecx` offline = white screen (SPA routing requirement).
- **vercel.json must ship in the same deployment as the first SW.** Vercel may cache sw.js indefinitely without `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers.
- **navigator.storage.persist() on WallecxApp.vue mount.** Mitigates (does not guarantee) iOS 7-day localStorage eviction of PocketBase auth token.
- **scope: '/' not '/projects/wallecx'.** Scoping to sub-path breaks cross-route navigation within the installed PWA.
- **Do NOT add `<link rel="manifest">` manually.** vite-plugin-pwa auto-injects it at build time.

### v2.1 PWA Build Decisions (Plan 14-04)

- **globIgnores: ['**/about-me-photo*']** — the about-me home page photo (9.85 MB) is excluded from Workbox precache; not needed offline for Wallecx PWA functionality.
- **maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes: 3 MiB** — vendor bundle (2.57 MiB, contains Vue/Pinia/Router) must be precached for app shell offline; 3 MiB limit accommodates it.
- **Task 2 human-verify auto-approved** — per auto_advance:true config; Chrome DevTools verification instructions documented in 14-04-SUMMARY.md for async follow-up.

### v2.2 Toolbar Implementation Notes

- **Reuse WallecxToolbar.vue** — already implements search + sort + view toggle for VaccinationsTab. Adapt for MembershipsTab via a prop to hide the view toggle (membership cards are always grid-view).
- **State lives in MembershipsTab.vue** — `searchQuery` ref + `sortMode` ref → `filteredSortedMemberships` computed → passed to card grid. Mirrors the VaccinationsTab pattern.
- **No new PocketBase queries.** All filtering and sorting is client-side on the already-loaded `memberships` ref.
- **Sort modes:** Name A–Z, Issuer A–Z, Expiry Date (soonest first; cards without expiry sorted last), Recently Added.
- **Session retention for sort mode** via `sessionStorage` — same approach as VaccinationsTab.
- **Empty state** when search matches zero cards — informative message, not a blank area.
- **sortOptions is a required prop on WallecxToolbar** — each tab must pass its own sort options array. VaccinationsTab passes `vaccinationSortOptions`; MembershipsTab will pass `membershipSortOptions`. (Established in Plan 16-01.)

### v2.3 Architectural Decisions (pre-planning)

- **Bottom sheet strategy: conditional `position` prop on PrimeVue Drawer.** VaccinationGroupPanel already uses `<Drawer position="right">`; switch to `position="bottom"` below 640px using `useWindowSize` from `@vueuse/core`. MembershipDetail currently uses `<Dialog>`; on mobile replace with `<Drawer position="bottom">` or conditionally render a bottom-anchored `<Drawer>` vs `<Dialog>`.
- **Reactive breakpoint via `useWindowSize`.** Already available in `@vueuse/core` (no new packages). Derive `const isMobile = computed(() => width.value < 640)`.
- **MOB-09 via existing `showToggle` prop pattern.** WallecxToolbar already accepts `showToggle`; add a responsive computed to VaccinationsTab that sets `showToggle` to `false` when `isMobile` is true and resets the active view to `'list'` on mount when mobile.
- **Dark mode fix strategy: scoped CSS variable overrides.** Target `.my-app-dark .p-card`, `.my-app-dark .p-dialog`, `.my-app-dark .p-drawer` etc. with CSS custom property overrides inside each Wallecx component's `<style scoped>`. No new packages required.
- **No new npm packages unless strictly necessary.** `useWindowSize` and Tailwind `sm:` breakpoints cover all detection needs.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
