# Lexarium

## What This Is

Lexarium is a personal Vue 3 SPA portfolio hub deployed on Vercel that hosts multiple mini-apps under `/projects/` (LexTrack, Larga, Gift Exchange, API Playground, Wallecx). v3.0 promotes Lexarium from "individual mini-apps" to a fully themed platform with site-wide dark mode.

**Wallecx**, the largest mini-app, is a personal records vault with three record types:

- **Vaccination records** — text fields (vaccine name, date, dose, lot, location, manufacturer, notes) plus an attached scan/photo of the card; grouped by vaccine type with search, sort, and view toggle
- **Membership cards** — loyalty, insurance, and ID cards with barcode/QR rendering, a full-screen scan overlay for counter use, and a coloured card grid
- **Expenses** — daily expense logging with category, description, receipt photo, and period-tabbed reporting (month / quarter / year / custom) with per-category breakdown charts

All three record types share the same per-user PocketBase isolation pattern, the same CRUD dialog + Zod validation + mapper architecture, and live in the same tabbed shell at `/projects/wallecx`.

## Core Value

**Each authenticated user can save, retrieve, and display their own vaccination records, membership/loyalty cards, and daily expenses — without ever losing access to them, and can track spending against per-category budget targets.**

If everything else fails, these capabilities must work: the vaccination history list (with attachment preview), the membership card grid (with barcode scan overlay), and the expenses list with reporting + budget comparison.

## Current Milestone: v4.3 Wallecx Mobile Optimization

**Goal:** Make Wallecx feel native-grade on mobile — tighten layout & touch targets, drop perceived load time on small-screen devices, and polish the PWA install + standalone experience.

**Target features:**
- Wallecx-wide mobile layout & touch-target audit across all 3 tabs (Vaccinations, Memberships, Expenses List + Reports) — responsive grids, 44px tap targets, bottom sheets, safe-area insets, no horizontal scroll, modal sizing
- Mobile performance improvements — bundle size, lazy-loading, image compression, first paint, list virtualization on long lists
- Forms & dialogs on small screens — Drawer-vs-Dialog mobile split refinement, sticky action bars, iOS 16px input-font fix, scroll trapping
- PWA install + standalone polish — iOS standalone, install banner, safe-area insets, app-icon polish

**Test viewports:** iOS Safari (~390px), Android Chrome (~360–412px), Tablet (~768–820px)

**Explicitly deferred from v4.3 scope:** HEALTH-01 (boot-time collection health check), UAT-28-CLOSE + UAT-29-CLOSE (16 deferred UAT scenarios), PB-REALTIME (uniform `wallecx_*` realtime subscribe). v4.3 stays mobile-focused.

## Previous State: v4.2 Shipped 2026-05-26

**Latest shipped:** v4.2 Budget Recovery & Hardening (2026-05-26) — closed two production-visible bugs discovered after v4.1 ship. BUG-01: re-created the missing `wallecx_expense_budgets` PocketBase collection via a paste-back gated Admin UI flow that replaced Phase 28-01's trust-based "approved" signal. BUG-02: refactored `ExpensesTab.vue` `onMounted` into independent try/catches so a budgets-only failure no longer fires the misleading `'Failed to load expenses…'` toast or blocks the expenses list. Locked new architectural invariant D-13 ("Admin-UI checkpoints require text paste-back + downstream smoke verify") that prevents the silent-no-op trust-based-checkpoint failure mode project-wide. One PocketBase v0.29.x count-path bug discovered + documented in deviation D-31-B (workaround via `getFullList()` or `getList(p, pp, { skipTotal: true })`).

**Previously shipped:** v4.1 Gap Resolution & Feature Completeness (2026-05-25) — closed deferred code-quality items (WR-01/02/03), added JSON exports for memberships and expenses, shipped budget tracking (Manage Budgets dialog + actual-vs-budget reports) and period-over-period comparison line, then ran a structured UAT sweep over 8 phases (80/82 in-scope scenarios passed, BR-2 barcode invariant verified twice, regression floor of 49/49 tests intact).

<details>
<summary>v4.1 milestone goal (shipped 2026-05-25)</summary>

**Goal:** Close deferred technical debt, add missing JSON exports, extend the expense tracker with budget and period-over-period comparison reporting, and verify untested UAT scenarios across past phases.

**Shipped:**
- CQ-01 expense_date calendar refinement; CQ-02 conditional notes spread on mapToUpdateExpense
- EXPORT-01 memberships JSON export; EXPORT-02 expenses JSON export
- `wallecx_expense_budgets` collection (per-user, monthly/yearly enum) + ExpenseBudget types + expenseBudgetMapper (RPT-01 data foundation) — NOTE: production PB collection was never actually created; v4.2 closes this gap
- `ManageBudget.vue` bulk-upsert modal (Dialog/Drawer + Promise.all create/update/delete-on-zero)
- ExpensesReportsView Budget vs Actual section + Manage Budgets button (RPT-01 + RPT-02 end-to-end)
- ExpensesReportsView inline period-over-period comparison line (RPT-03 — Month + Quarter coverage; error/success color tokens; zero-prior graceful handling; U+2212 minus)
- Phase 30 UAT sweep: 80/82 scenarios passed across 8 ROADMAP-named phases (10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25); 1 deferred (PWA standalone install needs install flow); 0 regressions

- ✓ ExpensesReportsView inline period-over-period comparison line in STATE 4 between Grand Total and Manage Budgets button — Month + Quarter coverage; color-coded direction (error red = overspending, success green = underspending); `↑ $230 (+23%) vs last month` format; honest zero-prior handling (omit %, append "no prior spend"); U+2212 minus — v4.1
- ✓ Structured Phase 30 UAT sweep over 8 ROADMAP-named phases (10, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25) — 80/82 scenarios passed, 1 deferred (PWA standalone install), 0 regressions; BR-2 barcode invariant verified twice — v4.1
- ✓ **BUG-01** — `wallecx_expense_budgets` PocketBase collection re-created in production with locked Phase 28-01 schema (4 fields, 5 rules with v0.29.3 `@request.body.user` createRule); paste-back gated Admin UI flow + `getFullList` 200 + empty array smoke verify; D-13 architectural invariant locked into STATE.md as workflow-layer prevention of silent-no-op checkpoints — v4.2
- ✓ **BUG-02** — `ExpensesTab.vue` `onMounted` refactored to independent try/catches; `loadBudgets()` gained `opts: { context: 'mount' | 'refresh' }` parameter with ternary toast (`'Failed to load budgets.'` vs `'Failed to refresh budgets after save. Reload to see changes.'`); `isLoading` wraps only the expenses fetch; budgets-only failure no longer fires misleading toast or blocks expenses list (UAT 1 close-the-loop signal verified) — v4.2
- ✓ **PF-01/02/04/05/07/09** — Wallecx mobile performance: vendor code-splitting (chart-js, jsbarcode, image-compression as priority-25 rolldown groups); WallecxApp.vue tabs + per-Manage* dialogs converted to `defineAsyncComponent` + Suspense; WallecxSkeleton with 5 byte-matched variants replacing 5 inline skeletons + 6 Suspense fallbacks (CLS ≤ 0.1 emulation-confirmed at 390×844); `perfInstrument.ts` `instrumentedGetFullList` wrapping all 5 mount-path getFullList calls with one-shot sessionStorage gate + localStorage `wallecx:perf-baseline` writes; shared `compressToWebP.ts` helper (fileType: image/webp, .webp filename rename) adopted in all 3 Manage* upload paths; index.html PocketBase-origin preconnect + dns-prefetch hints. Wallecx route chunk gzip 64.09 KB → 2.13 KB (−96.7%; target ≥50% met 15×). NFR-REQUESTKEY-UNIQUE closed (all 5 mount-path keys distinct + explicit in STATE.md). Phase 38 carry-overs: real-device PF-05 baseline reading, real-device CLS final-check, ManageVaccination current-card thumbnail polish — v4.3

### Active

v4.3 Wallecx Mobile Optimization — Phases 33–36 complete (2026-05-28). Phase 37 next: PWA Install + Standalone Polish (PWA-01/02/04/06/07/09). Then Phase 38: Mobile UAT Sweep + PWA-UAT-01 + close out the 3 carry-overs (real-device PF-05 baseline, real-device CLS final-check, ManageVaccination current-card thumbnail). Phase 38b (conditional list virtualization) pending the real-device PF-05 read. See `REQUIREMENTS.md` for the canonical traceability table.

### Future candidates

- [ ] **EXP-ADV-02** — Recurring expenses (mark as recurring; auto-create future entries)
- [ ] **EXP-ADV-03** — Multi-currency support (currency field + FX conversion at report time)
- [ ] **EXP-ADV-05** — Year-over-year period comparison (extend RPT-03 to this-year vs last-year; trivial dayjs.subtract('year') extension)
- [ ] **EXP-ADV-06** — Custom-range period comparison (same-length preceding window for Custom periods)
- [ ] **EXP-ADV-08** — Multi-period trend / sparkline (visualize last N periods inline near the Grand Total)
- [ ] **CONV-03** — Expiry date reminders (requires notification infrastructure)
- [ ] **SCAN-ADV-01** — PDF417 and Aztec code formats via dynamic `bwip-js` import
- [ ] **PWA-UAT-01** — PWA standalone install + toggle + re-open verification (deferred from Phase 22 V6)
- [ ] **HEALTH-01** (deferred from v4.2) — Code-level collection health check on app boot or Reports tab mount: probe `wallecx_expense_budgets` reachability and surface an inline warning (with PB Admin UI setup steps) if missing. Complements the v4.2 D-13 workflow-layer invariant with a runtime safety net.
- [ ] **UAT-28-CLOSE** (deferred from v4.2) — Walk through Phase 28's 9 deferred UAT scenarios in `28-HUMAN-UAT.md` now that the collection is healthy.
- [ ] **UAT-29-CLOSE** (deferred from v4.2) — Walk through Phase 29's 7 deferred UAT scenarios in `29-HUMAN-UAT.md` (period comparison validation).
- [ ] **PB-REALTIME** (captured during v4.2 Phase 32 discussion) — PocketBase realtime `subscribe('*', cb)` / `unsubscribe('*')` lifecycle for `wallecx_*` collections to replace `@budgets-saved`-driven manual refetch and similar emit-up-refetch patterns. Apply uniformly across all wallecx collections rather than ad-hoc on one.

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Apple Wallet / Google Wallet export | Requires server-side certificate signing |
| NFC tap-to-add | Browser SPA cannot reliably access NFC hardware |
| Live points balance / account integration | Per-issuer OAuth / scraping — excessive complexity |
| Barcode camera scanning to populate value | ZXing build cost exceeds manual entry benefit |
| Calendar view for vaccinations | List + detail is enough for a small dataset |
| OCR / auto-populating fields from card image | Manual entry is acceptable |
| Sharing a record / shareable link | Per-user privacy is the default |
| PDF export / printable summary | Attached card scan covers "show this" use case |
| Multi-language / localization | English only, matching the rest of Lexarium |
| Full offline data access | PocketBase has no offline SDK; IndexedDB replica is out of scope for v2.1 |
| Public unauthenticated access | Vaccination and membership data is sensitive |

## Context

**Codebase environment** — Existing Lexarium SPA. Deep map lives in `.planning/codebase/` (STACK, ARCHITECTURE, STRUCTURE, CONVENTIONS, TESTING, INTEGRATIONS, CONCERNS). Key patterns Wallecx must follow:

- Mini-app convention: `src/components/projects/wallecx/` folder; `WallecxApp.vue` is the thin shell registered as a lazy route in `src/router/index.ts` with `meta: { requiresAuth: true }`
- Backend: shared `pb` singleton at `src/lib/pocketbase/index.ts`. Each record type has a types module (`src/types/wallecx/*/types.d.ts`) and a write mapper (`src/lib/pocketbase/*Mapper.ts`)
- UI: PrimeVue (Aura preset) + Tailwind v4 + Rubik. PrimeVue components auto-imported via `unplugin-vue-components`. `useConfirm` must be imported explicitly — not auto-resolved
- Auth: `useAuthStore` (Pinia setup store); `pb.authStore.record!.id` requires a null guard before use
- Dates: `dayjs` everywhere; PocketBase date filters use `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format
- File tokens: fetched at view time, not list time; `requestKey` must be distinct per collection to prevent auto-cancel

**Current state (v4.1 shipped — planning next milestone):**
- ~5,200 LOC TypeScript/Vue across `src/components/projects/wallecx/` (v4.1 added ~410 lines: ManageBudget 240, ExpensesReportsView Phase 28+29 additions, ExpensesTab budget fetch + JSON exports, mappers)
- 49 Vitest tests passing (vaccinationMapper.spec.ts × 10, guard.spec.ts × 3, membershipMapper.spec.ts × 11, expenseMapper.spec.ts × 9, period.test.ts × 16)
- Runtime deps: `qrcode.vue@^3.9.1`, `jsbarcode@^3.12.3`, `browser-image-compression@^2.0.2`, `vue-pdf-embed@^2.1.4`, `chart.js@^4.5.1`
- Dev deps: `vite-plugin-pwa@^1.3.0`, `workbox-window@^7.4.1`, `workbox-build@^7.4.1`, `@vite-pwa/assets-generator@^1.0.2`
- Four PocketBase collections: `wallecx_vaccinations`, `wallecx_memberships`, `wallecx_expenses`, `wallecx_expense_categories`, `wallecx_expense_budgets`
- Three-tab shell: Vaccinations / Memberships / Expenses; Expenses tab has List + Reports sub-tabs; parent-shell + child-view SFC split pattern established
- Reports view: period selector → Grand Total hero → period-over-period comparison line (v4.1 RPT-03) → Manage Budgets button → chart → Budget vs Actual section (v4.1 RPT-01/02)
- PWA: installable, SW precaches, vercel.json deployed
- Mobile layouts: grid-cols-1 responsive, 44px touch targets, safe-area insets, bottom sheets (mobile), iOS install banner
- Dark mode: site-wide via useTheme composable + .my-app-dark on html; all Wallecx surfaces correct including charts via useChartTheme; BR-2 barcode invariant (black-on-white in both themes) reverified in v4.1 Phase 30 sweep

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Vue 3 + Vite 8 (rolldown) + PrimeVue 4 (Aura) + Pinia + Vue Router + Tailwind v4 + PocketBase — Locked
- **Hosting**: Static deploy on Vercel. No server-side code beyond PocketBase
- **Auth**: Reuse existing PocketBase users + Pinia `useAuthStore`. No separate identity store
- **Privacy**: Per-user isolation enforced server-side via PocketBase collection rules — not just client-side route guards
- **Design system**: Lexarium navy/amber palette + Rubik font + PrimeVue Aura preset — no new design tokens
- **Naming**: Mini-app folder `src/components/projects/wallecx/`, root `WallecxApp.vue`, route name `wallecx`

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Build Wallecx as a Lexarium mini-app | Fits portfolio pattern; reuses auth, design system, PocketBase | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| Multi-user from day 1 | Reuses existing PocketBase auth; per-user rules avoid a future migration | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| File attachments in v1 | The card scan *is* the record for most people | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| Standard field set (not Minimal, not Comprehensive) | Lot number is useful for recalls; clinical fields are excess | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| Re-use Lexarium design system | No reason for a new visual identity on one mini-app | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| `vaccine_type` optional in schema but required in form | No destructive migration for existing records; clean going forward | ✓ Validated v1.1 |
| Phase 6 reuses existing VaccinationDetail.vue without modification | GROUP-07 explicitly scopes to reuse | ✓ Validated v1.1 |
| Search/sort/view-toggle as pure client-side computed changes | No new PocketBase queries for v1.2 features | ✓ Validated v1.2 |
| PrimeVue Tabs over sub-routes for tab switching | Sub-routes break existing `/projects/wallecx` bookmarks | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| Each tab owns its own state; no new Pinia store | VaccinationsTab + MembershipsTab are self-contained | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| ManageMembership.vue uses direct v-model refs, not @primevue/forms | PrimeVue ColorPicker issue #8135 — controlled system ignores initial value | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| `card_color` stored without `#` prefix | Matches ColorPicker emit format; all CSS bindings prepend `#` | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| iOS fullscreen via viewport overlay, not Fullscreen API | `requestFullscreen()` unsupported on non-video elements iOS < 26 | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| Every JsBarcode() call wrapped in try/catch | JsBarcode has no soft-fail mode; invalid input throws synchronously | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| ConfirmDialog kept at WallecxApp.vue shell level | `useConfirm` broadcasts to single app-shell-level instance | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| category stored as denormalized Text (not Relation) | Prevents retroactive history rewrite when a category is renamed | ✓ Validated v4.0 |
| DEFAULT_EXPENSE_CATEGORIES seeded lazily on first dialog open | No PocketBase signup hook needed; seeding in ManageExpense.vue on first open | ✓ Validated v4.0 |
| Period selector uses PrimeVue Tabs (scrollable) | Established PrimeVue pattern for mutually-exclusive options; scrollable handles narrow-viewport overflow | ✓ Validated v4.0 |
| Chart palette fully reactive via useChartTheme refs | MutationObserver on html element reads CSS vars; PrimeVue Chart's deep-watch re-renders automatically on .my-app-dark toggle | ✓ Validated v4.0 |
| dayjs Q-format template literal (not format token) | quarterOfYear plugin patches .quarter() accessors but NOT format() grammar — `Q${now.quarter()} ${now.format('YYYY')}` required | ✓ Validated v4.0 |
| Parent-shell + child-view SFC split for ExpensesTab | Shell owns data + dialogs; sibling views (ExpensesListView, ExpensesReportsView) own view-specific UI state and emit intent events | ✓ Validated v4.0 |
| PocketBase v0.29.3 createRule uses `@request.body.user` (NOT deprecated `@request.data.user`) | Confirmed against live PB instance during Phase 28; deprecated syntax causes create to return 403 | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| `wallecx_expense_budgets` requestKey is `'expense-budgets-getFullList'` (locked invariant) | Must stay distinct from `expenses-getFullList`, `expense-categories-getFullList`, `vaccinations-getFullList`, `memberships-getFullList` to prevent PocketBase auto-cancel | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| Bulk-upsert with Promise.all create/update/delete-on-zero | ManageBudget.vue dispatches concurrent writes per row; partial-failure acceptable for non-critical personal data; parent re-fetches on 'saved' to reflect actual server state | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| Period-gated UI sections use `v-if` (DOM absent, not just hidden) | Phase 28 D-09 + Phase 29 D-01 — Budget vs Actual and period-comparison line both follow this pattern; non-applicable periods produce zero-length collections that collapse the section entirely | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| Status color tokens map to value judgment: error=overspending, success=underspending, muted=neutral | Single mental model across Reports view (Budget vs Actual + period comparison) — red signals overspend, green signals underspend | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| U+2212 minus character (−) for negative percentages, not ASCII hyphen-minus | Typographic correctness; locked in ExpensesReportsView Phase 29 helper | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| Period comparison covers Month + Quarter only (Year + Custom hidden) | Roadmap-strict scope; year/custom deferred (EXP-ADV-05/06) to keep RPT-03 surface area minimal | ✓ Validated v4.1 |
| Phase 30 UAT sweep as one-plan-per-phase | 8 plans (30-01..30-08), each with checkpoint:human-verify + result-recording task; failures batch-handled at end via gap-closure fix plans | ✓ Validated v4.1 (0 failures actually needed — sweep was clean) |
| Admin-UI checkpoints require text paste-back + downstream smoke verify (D-13 invariant) | Trust-based "approved" signals silently no-op'd Phase 28-01 Task 1 and caused BUG-01. Now project-wide: any phase configuring a live external artifact (PB collection, env vars, dashboard settings) MUST require the user to paste back actual configured values as text AND a code-side smoke probe must exercise the live artifact. Acknowledgment-only is explicitly insufficient | ✓ Validated v4.2 (mitigated T-31-05 process-level threat; locked structurally for all future GSD admin-UI tasks) |
| PocketBase v0.29.x `getList()` count-path bug against non-trivial listRule expressions | The totalItems COUNT path trips on `@request.auth.id != "" && user = @request.auth.id`-shaped listRule expressions, returning 400 "Something went wrong". `getFullList()` uses skipTotal internally and works correctly. Workarounds: `getFullList()` or explicit `getList(p, pp, { skipTotal: true })` | ✓ Documented v4.2 (D-31-B; not a project defect, but a PB SDK/server quirk worth knowing) |
| `loadBudgets()` carries call-site context via `opts.context: 'mount' \| 'refresh'` parameter (default 'refresh') | Single source of truth for the budgets fetch; ternary toast branches to the appropriate copy without duplicating the `getFullList` block. Default `'refresh'` preserves the existing `@budgets-saved="loadBudgets"` template binding without modification | ✓ Validated v4.2 |
| `isLoading` skeleton state wraps only the headline data fetch in `onMounted`, not supporting data | BUG-02 isolation: the budgets path should not block or delay the expenses list rendering. `isLoading` clears in the expenses `try/finally`; supporting fetches (budgets) run sequentially after, outside the skeleton envelope | ✓ Validated v4.2 |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
